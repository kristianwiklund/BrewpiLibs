These files are adaptations of code from the avr brewpi for the arduino brewpi shield rev C, to make it possible to use them from within the Arduino IDE. 

Original repo https://github.com/BrewPi/brewpi-avr


The changes are minor and consists mostly of commenting out code and renaming a few things.

You will also need the "DigitalIO" arduino library downloadable from within the arduino IDE, to be able to use the fastpin implementation from that lib.
